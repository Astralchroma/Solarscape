<h1>Solarscape (Gateway) v0.0.0</h1>
<p>
	You probably aren't supposed to be here right now (unless you are), but that's not an issue, everything you see here
	is barebones right now as the goal is to make a technically playable public alpha that we can use as the foundations
	to continue developing the game, so that's why this page looks straight out of the early 90s.
</p>
<p>
	The database won't be reset prior to the public alpha launch unless something goes wrong and it's easier to just
	nuke it and start over, so feel free to create your account now and effectively reserve your username.

	<h3>Username</h3>
	<input type=text name=username placeholder=Username><br>
	<i>(<code style="background: lightgray">0-9A-Za-z_</code>, 1..=32 characters )</i><br>

	<h3>Email</h3>
	<input type=email name=email placeholder=Email>
	<p style="color: red">
		While required, Email Addresses aren't currently verified. Once verification is implemented, all accounts will
		be locked pending Email verification. While you can provide a dummy Email now, you do so risking losing access
		to your account in the future, no support will be provided.
	</p>

	<h3>Password</h3>
	<input type=password name=password placeholder=Password><br>
	<p>
		<i>For the rightfully security conscious, while this is barebones, we have not cut corners on password security,
			passwords are hashed and salted with Argon2.</i>
